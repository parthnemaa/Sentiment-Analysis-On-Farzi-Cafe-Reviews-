## **Introduction**
The **Farzi Cafe Sentiment Analysis** notebook offers a systematic workflow for extracting, processing, and interpreting customer sentiment from restaurant reviews with advanced NLP techniques. This project transforms raw feedback into actionable insights for business strategy and customer engagement [attached_file:1].

## **Methodology**
- **Data Acquisition:** Imports and structures raw review datasets using pandas for optimal data management [attached_file:1].
- **Preprocessing:** Applies robust text cleanup including tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Leverages and compares VADER, logistic regression, and additional machine learning classifiers, emphasizing evaluation rigor.
- **Visualization:** Creates clear, insightful plots using matplotlib, seaborn, and wordcloud for comprehensive analysis.

## **Data Sources**
Analysis is performed on customer review datasets, either supplied, retrieved via API, or simulated for demonstration. Data structure and origin are referenced within notebook documentation [attached_file:1].

## **Installation**

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Lab or Notebook

**Required Libraries**
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn wordcloud


## **Usage Guide**

1. Clone/download the repository and open a terminal in its directory.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Farzi-Cafe-Sentiment.ipynb

3. Execute cells in order: data import, preprocessing, sentiment modeling, and result visualization.
4. Modify parameters or data sections to experiment and adapt analysis for future datasets.


## **Reproducibility**
Every process step is annotated for end-to-end reproducibility. The workflow uses fixed random seeds and supplies instructions for rerunning or adapting the notebook to new datasets [attached_file:1].

## **Contributing**
Contributions to improve code structure, add new models, or expand visualization approaches are welcome! Adhere to PEP8 for code style and provide clear commit messages [attached_file:1].
